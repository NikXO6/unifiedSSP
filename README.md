# Unified SSO for Google & Microsoft

This WordPress plugin lets you offer Google and Microsoft login to your WordPress site.  
After activation a **Unified SSO** menu appears with pages to configure OAuth applications, map profile fields, tweak the login button and view login reports.  
Data removal on uninstall is optional from the **Data** page.

This project implements the admin UI and option handling only. OAuth flows and actual authentication are placeholders and require further development.
